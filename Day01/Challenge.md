# #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge - Day 1

---

Welcome to the #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge with the #TrainWithShubham Community! Today marks the beginning of our exciting journey into the world of DevOps. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what you need to do today.

## Overview
In this first day of the challenge, we will explore the fundamentals of DevOps, learn about automation, scaling, and infrastructure, and understand why DevOps is crucial in modern software development. You will also engage with the community by sharing your insights.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic concepts of DevOps.
- Learn about automation, scaling, and infrastructure.
- Recognize the importance of DevOps in the software development lifecycle.
- Share your knowledge and connect with fellow participants.

## Key Concepts
### What is DevOps?
DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops). It is a set of practices that aims to shorten the development lifecycle, improve software quality, and enable continuous delivery. The goal is to bring development and operations teams together to work collaboratively throughout the entire software development process.

### What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?
- **Automation:** This refers to the use of technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention. In DevOps, automation helps streamline processes such as testing, deployment, and monitoring, making them faster and more reliable.
  
- **Scaling:** This is the ability to handle increased loads by adding resources. In a DevOps context, scaling can mean adding more servers or optimizing applications to ensure they can manage more users or data effectively.

- **Infrastructure:** This includes all the physical and virtual resources that support the operations of applications, such as servers, storage, networks, and services. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key concept in DevOps, allowing teams to manage and provision infrastructure using code.

### Why DevOps is Important?
DevOps is important because it helps organizations:
- Deliver software faster and more reliably.
- Improve collaboration between development and operations teams.
- Enhance the quality of software through continuous testing and integration.
- Respond quickly to market changes and customer feedback.

## Commands Covered:

### 1. Forking a Repository
To participate in the challenge, you will need to fork the repository. Follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Go to the GitHub repository you want to fork.
   - Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.

2. **Clone Your Forked Repository:**
   After forking, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPOSITORY_NAME with the name of the repository you forked.

3. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:

    - cd REPOSITORY_NAME

4. **Check the Remote Repository:** To see the remote repositories linked to your local repository, use:

    - git remote -v

5. **Making Changes and Committing:** After making changes to the files, you can stage and commit them:

    - git add .
    
    - git commit -m "Your commit message here"

6. **Pushing Changes to Your Fork:** To push your changes back to your forked repository on GitHub, use:

    - git push origin main
